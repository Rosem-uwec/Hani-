            <p>At Hani, we offer a variety of honey types to suit every taste and need. From our classic raw wildflower honey to rich clover and delicate orange blossom, each type has its own unique flavor and aroma. We also create small-batch infused honeys, like cinnamon and lavender, for those who enjoy something a little different. All of our honey is naturally sourced and never blended with artificial ingredients. Whether you're cooking, baking, or sweetening your tea, there's a perfect Hani honey for every moment.</p>
